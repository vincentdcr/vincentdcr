### Hi there 👋

I'm Vincent, an aspiring French developer currently enrolled as an engineering student at Polytech Grenoble[^1]. I've been programming for 6 years now, starting in my free time with basic websites and slowly discovering new languages and concepts since then. Here is a list of the languages I'm familiar with :

- 🇨 C
- ☕ Java
- 🐍 Python
- 🐫 Ocaml
- 🐓 Coq
- 🔺 OpenGL
- 🇷 R
- 🔟 ARM assembler
- 💽 SQL
- ✨ HTML/CSS
- 📜 JavaScript

In the future, I would like to gain experience with React, C++ or C# and discover more about graphics programming. 
Over the years, I found a lot of things that I quite enjoy about programming, but if I were to list the top 3 things at this current time, I would say : graphics programming, statistical analysis using python and/or R, building apps that people can interact with.

### Projects 📐

Below, you will find some of the projects I have worked on recently, those include a basic memory allocator written in C, a 2D Java game made with a squad of 7 other people over the span of 3 weeks and an OpenGL engine programmed in the same amount of time.

You can also check out my portfolio where I present some of them : [Here](./Portfolio.pdf)
